# Welcome to Fashion Trend Analysis Repository
## About
This is a Mini Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on the fashion trend from [The Fashion Trend Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fashionworldda/fashion-trend-dataset). For more detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from below:

## Problem Definition

- Are we able to make predictions on fashion data if fashion is ever-changing and hard to predict?
- Are we able to predict and classify the gender of customer based on the sales count of various category of clothing?

## Models Used

1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest

## Conclusion

- Data set with unpredictable and chaotic nature is not suitable for linear regression
- Classifying and making predictions based on too many data will result in a decision tree that is too big, 
  taking a very long time to run, or it would result in less accurate classification when max depth is limited.
- Random Forest can make more accurate prediction and classification compared to Decision Tree as Random Forest 
  makes classification based on multiple Decision Trees
- Choosing predictors with better correlation with the response data is essential for more accurate classification
- It is possible to make prediction on fahsion data but only on data that has a stable high correlation and with sufficient data
- It is possible to make prediction on the gender by classifying sales count on various category of clothing

## Lessons Learnt

- Handling imbalanced and limited dataset with a somewhat unpredictable and chaotic nature
- Creating a pivot table from the extracted data
- Further understanding of how decision tree works in classifying data
- Understanding the use of Random Forest in classification and prediction
- Learning to plot three dimensional (3D) graphs using matplotlib module
- Collaborating using GitHub
- Understanding the different uses of linear regression and classification
