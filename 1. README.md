## Problem Definition

- Are we able to make predictions on fashion data if fashion is ever-changing and hard to predict?
- Are we able to predict and classify the gender of customer based on the sales count of various category of clothing?

## Models Used

1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Gradient Boosting

## Techniques Used

1. One Hot Encoding
2. Grid Search

## Conclusion

- Data set with unpredictable and chaotic nature is not suitable for linear regression
- Classifying and making predictions based on too many data will result in a decision tree that is too big, 
  taking a very long time to run, or it would result in less accurate classification when max depth is limited.
- Random Forest can make more accurate prediction and classification compared to Decision Tree as Random Forest 
  makes classification based on multiple Decision Trees
- Gradient Boosting leads to the most accurate classification among the 3 models used as it builds trees sequentially, with each tree 
  trying to correct the errors made by the previous one, which also reduces overfitting issues
- Choosing predictors with better correlation with the response data is essential for more accurate classification
- Using One Hot Encoding to turn categorical data into numerical data helps to increase accuracy for both random forest and gradient 
  boosting as they are more suited for numerical data
- Using Grid Search helps to choose the best model for fitting which can lead to more accurate prediction and classification
- It is possible to make prediction on fahsion data but only on data that has a stable high correlation and with sufficient data
- It is possible to make prediction on the gender by classifying sales count on various category of clothing
